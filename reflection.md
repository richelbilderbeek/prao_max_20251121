# Reflection

The goal of a reflection is to improve.

One does so writing down how a passed day went:
what did yo do, how did it go and how can it be improved?

By forcing oneself to think of this, one can actually learn from the past.

## What did you do?
see report ;)

## What did you do well?
i think that i somehow made at least one wepsite work, that is good enuth for me.

## What could be improved?
i dont relly know what i cold have done better mayby not using that much AI like I was told but i at least made it work out

## What did your supervisor do well?
i think my supervisor relly did put in the effort of axely makeing so i did understand what i was supose to do and that he never relly lost thefe in mi even when i got practetly no progres in the start.

## How can your supervisor be improved?
this mite be more of a me problem but i had a hard time understanding the task at fierst and it was good that you was like i want to know what you remember and sei what you think is rigt but wrong but i might be good to like sheck whit them onced in a while cus if they are like me and dont ask questrions.

## What would you do differently next time?
i shold have asked more questrions. for som reson my brain was like i don,t know how the end project is going to look like so a gues i shold not ask him for it. if i wold have asked for how this work and that bla bla bla i probebly whold have knownd a bit better what to  do

## Which tip would you give to future PRAO students?
PLEASE aks questrions cus sometimes when you dont understand dont ask the stuped AI instede ska the smart human who is next to you at almost all the time he knows better then AI trust me ;)
