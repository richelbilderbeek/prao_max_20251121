## Project from supervisor

Make it possible that the Zensical website of
[https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_intro_python](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_intro_python)
gets deployed upon a commit.
Document how to make this work in such a way anyone can do it.

## How to do so

the fierst thing that you need to do is to find the script that creates the wepsite. then the only thing that you need to do is to change the gh-pages to github-pages. today i have bin trying to solve a problem. the problem is that when you make the website, instade of doing the "new one" it makes the "old one" and that was what i was trying to do. so i went to chatgpt cus thats the way i get to know stuf.  so i ask it some quesrions intill i get to frustrietet cus AI SUCKS. so i went to the site that was rigten at the top of a script and just copied over the hole script and it magecly workt. but when i was going to do it on anuther site, it dident work. so i tryed to desprety fix it but in the end the only thing that "i" got done was to discover this error "Error: TypeError: failed to extract field Markdown.meta" so if you fix that is shold hopuly work :)
