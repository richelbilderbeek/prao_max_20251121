# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well

I treated Max like a colleague.

## What I could do better

I have no idea. Maybe he has something?

## My conclusion about my PRAO

I've seen the following

- Max was 9 minutes late. However, he made more than up for it by skipping breaks and getting back to work sooner
- Max was eager to make it work: we had shorter breaks all day
- Max does need something to do: without a computer, he definitely was more distracted (and distracting)
- Max seems to have spent all the concentration he had after 7 hours. I would say that is well done: the job was hard and he is untrained in being focused that long

In the end, we once got the project working, yet we failed to reproduce thsi. Too bad!

As a conclusion: I would definitely recommend Max as a PRAO. Do make sure he has something challenging to do!
